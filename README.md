A calculator with some extra functionality. This program lets users enter 2 numbers, and then choose what functions to run on those numbers. The basic operations in this program are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo. Additionally, it also has functionality to check if the two numbers entered are prime, and to create a Fibonacci sequence starting with those two numbers.
This was converted from the CoolCalculator program I made in Java into a website using HTML/Javascript/CSS with a nicer UI
